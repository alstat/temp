=========================

EDC is a Lopez Company focusing on energy distribution. The production involves drilling of the reservoir to extract the heat that produces energy. The company has several divisions involved in the production, from design of the hole, to determination of the optimal drilling path, to costing of the materials and services.

One of the division of the company as mentioned above involves in the costing of the permutation. This is done using different combination of the drilling permutation which is manually calculated by the employees using MS Excel.

To address this problem, NeuralMechanics proposed automation of the calculation using Web Application for accuracy and efficiency; and this repository hoards the source codes of the proposed app.
